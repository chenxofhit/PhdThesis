Figures are generated with the following softwares and scripts:

- *.graffle files are the source files of some generated pdf files.The files can be edited with Ominigraffle in a Mac OS runnning machine.
- *.R are the R script files to generate figures especially for scientific anlaysis.
- *.ppt are the Microsoft Powerpoint files also to generate some figures.

At present, Ominigraffle can not directly support svg files, so Sketch is  as a remedy.  

And，Microsoft Powerpoint does not export the pdf according to the exact size of the content，the figure are then pasted to Ominigraffle for a remedy.

各取所长，相得益彰。
