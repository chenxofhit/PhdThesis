Figures are generated with the following softwares and scripts:

- *.graffle files is the source files of some generated pdf files.The files can be edited with Ominigraffle in a Mac OS runnning machine.
- *.R is the R script files to generate figures especially for scientific anlaysis.
- *.ppt is the Microsoft Powerpoint files also to generate some figures.

At present, Ominigraffle can not directly support svg files, so Sketch is used as a bridge.
