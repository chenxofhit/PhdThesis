@article{Srinivasan511626,
	Abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a recent technology that enables fine-grained discovery of cellular subtypes and specific cell states. It routinely uses machine learning methods, such as feature learning, clustering, and classification, to assist in uncovering novel information from scRNA-seq data. However, current methods are not well suited to deal with the substantial amounts of noise that is created by the experiments or the variation that occurs due to differences in the cells of the same type. Here, we develop a new hybrid approach, Deep Unsupervised Single-cell Clustering (DUSC), that integrates feature generation based on a deep learning architecture with a model-based clustering algorithm, to find a compact and informative representation of the single-cell transcriptomic data generating robust clusters. We also include a technique to estimate an efficient number of latent features in the deep learning model. Our method outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art feature learning and clustering methods, approaching the accuracy of supervised learning. The method is freely available to the community and will hopefully facilitate our understanding of the cellular atlas of living organisms as well as provide the means to improve patient diagnostics and treatment.},
